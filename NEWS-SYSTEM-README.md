# Enhanced News System Documentation

## Overview
The enhanced news system allows you to manage news feeds in separate category files, making it easier to:
- Add new categories without touching the main JavaScript file
- Have different people manage different categories
- Load only the categories that are needed
- Maintain better organization of feed sources

## System Architecture

### 1. Category-Specific JSON Files
Each news category has its own JSON file (e.g., `AI.json`, `Cybersecurity.json`) containing:
- Category name and description
- Array of feed objects with name, URL, and type

### 2. Master Index File
`news-categories-index.json` contains:
- List of all available categories
- File paths to category JSON files
- Metadata about the system

### 3. Enhanced JavaScript
`news-feeds-enhanced.js` includes:
- All original functionality from `news-feeds.js`
- Read/unread article tracking using localStorage
- Color-coded category buttons
- Fallback to hardcoded feeds if JSON files fail

## Color-Coded Button System

### Button States
- **GREEN** = New/unread articles present in that category
- **RED** = All articles in that category have been read (nothing new)
- **Pulse Animation** = Green buttons pulse to draw attention to new content

### How It Works
1. When articles are loaded, they're marked as unread by default
2. When a user clicks on an article, it's marked as read
3. Category buttons update their color based on read status
4. Read status is persisted in localStorage

## Adding New Categories

### Step 1: Create Category JSON File
Create a new JSON file (e.g., `NewCategory.json`):

```json
{
  "category": "New Category",
  "description": "Description of the new category",
  "feeds": [
    {
      "name": "Feed Name",
      "url": "https://example.com/feed",
      "type": "rss"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Update Master Index
Add the new category to `news-categories-index.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "New Category",
  "file": "NewCategory.json",
  "description": "Description of the new category"
}
```

### Step 3: Add to HTML
Add the category button to `news-enhanced.html`:

```html
<button class="category-filter" data-category="New Category">
  New Category
</button>
```

## Feed Types

### RSS Feeds
```json
{
  "name": "Feed Name",
  "url": "https://example.com/rss",
  "type": "rss"
}
```

### YouTube Feeds
```json
{
  "name": "Channel Name",
  "url": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID",
  "type": "youtube"
}
```

## Features

### Original Features (Preserved)
- RSS and YouTube feed parsing
- Date filtering (today, yesterday, this week, etc.)
- Search functionality
- Pagination with "Load More"
- Category filtering
- Article grouping by date
- Video modal for YouTube content

### New Features
- **Read/Unread Tracking**: Articles are marked as read when clicked
- **Color-Coded Buttons**: Visual indication of new content
- **Persistent Storage**: Read status saved in localStorage
- **Fallback System**: Uses hardcoded feeds if JSON files fail
- **Enhanced UI**: Visual feedback for read/unread states

## Troubleshooting

### Category Not Loading
1. Check if the JSON file exists and is valid
2. Verify the category name matches in HTML and JSON
3. Check browser console for errors

### Feeds Not Loading
1. Verify feed URLs are accessible
2. Check CORS proxy availability
3. Review browser console for network errors

### Color Coding Not Working
1. Ensure `news-feeds-enhanced.js` is loaded
2. Check localStorage permissions
3. Verify CSS styles are applied

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with localStorage support
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support

## Performance Notes
- Feeds are loaded asynchronously
- Read status is cached in localStorage
- Images are lazy-loaded
- Pagination reduces initial load time
